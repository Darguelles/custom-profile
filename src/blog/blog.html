          Along with my work, i like to share my experience with other colleages and get feedback from them, so i started
          participating as an active member of Medium community, i think that's the best place were people can find
          articles based more on real life experiences instead just the tipical academic scope.

          But not all in my life is work. I like do distribute my time with m,y second passion too: Music, more specific,
          play guitar. I'm a 80's, 90's rock lover, follower of great bands like Guns N Roses, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin,
          Audioslave, and maybe the list wont finish soon...
